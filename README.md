# QR-Code-Component

Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor that I received from The Women Techsters Bootcamp.


# Overview

This was a simple yet complicated project. I realised there are a lot of ways that can be used to solve the same problem e.g I didn't have to put fixed width and height dimensions for the qr code image. I controlled the image size using the container dimensions and positioning.


# What I learned

I struggled a lot with CSS, to be specific centering of my container and positionining. I need to work on that more.


# Useful resources

w3schools.com - This helped me for centering. 

YouTube - There are a lot of videos that touch on the difference between padding and margins that I went through while I was busy with this project. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

@SankThomas, This helped me with the finishing touches of the project, like the margins and height of my container(how to make them suitable for different devices).
